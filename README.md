# QR Code Generator

This project is a simple **QR Code Generator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The app allows users to generate a QR code based on any text or URL input and provides the option to download the generated QR code as a PNG image.

## Features

- **Input URL/Text**: Users can enter any text or URL to generate a QR code.
- **Generate QR Code**: The app uses an external API (`https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/`) to dynamically generate a QR code for the provided input.
- **Download QR Code**: Once the QR code is generated, users can download the image to their device as a PNG file with just one click.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on all devices.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The app features smooth transitions when displaying the generated QR code.

## How It Works

1. Enter the text or URL you want to convert into a QR code.
2. Click the "Generate QR Code" button.
3. Once the QR code is generated, it will be displayed in the app.
4. A "Download QR Code" button will appear, allowing you to download the QR code image as a PNG.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup for the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styling the app, making it look clean and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity, such as generating the QR code and downloading the image.
- **QR Code API**: The app uses `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/` to dynamically generate the QR codes based on the input.
